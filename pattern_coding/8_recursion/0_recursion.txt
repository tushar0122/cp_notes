The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.

What are the advantages of recursive programming over iterative programming? 
Recursion provides a clean and simple way to write code
Recursion helps in logic building. Recursive thinking helps in solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.

What are the disadvantages of recursive programming over iterative programming?
Note every recursive program can be written iteratively and vice versa is also true.
Recursive programs typically have more space requirements and also more time to maintain the recursion call stack.
Recursion can make the code more difficult to understand and debug, since it requires thinking about multiple levels of function calls..
