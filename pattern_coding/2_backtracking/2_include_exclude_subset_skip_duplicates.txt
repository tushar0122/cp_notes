Duplicate possible only when a number is repeated 
4 2 1 2 1 
4 2 1 
We can remove it with list 
But ordering also may change so not equal 
to solve this 
sort the array
and also skip duplicates

Skipping duplicates
What it means it 
If i started with 1 
i don't want other 1 to start with 
1, 2 is there then i don't need another 1, 2
1, 1, 2 is fine 

so skipping only at excluding logic
