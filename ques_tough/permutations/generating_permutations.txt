recursion 
    => 
each recursion level we have some starting index, for that starting index, we swap with all next indexes on right
starting index will be 0, then increment by 1 till end 
1st element with 1st 

1, 2, 3 
    1, 2, 3
        => 1, 2, 3
        => 1, 3, 2 
    2, 1, 3
        => 2, 1, 3
        =>  2, 3, 1
    3, 2, 1
        => 3,2,1
        =>  3, 1, 2

n*(n-1)*(n-2)...1
n! time complexity
