Graph 
    => Can have any number of edges.	
    => Can form cycles; may be directed or not.
    => Root May or may not exist.	
    => Multiple paths may exist between nodes.
    => n (nodes) and m (edges) can vary freely.
    => Self loops
    => Multiple roots 
    => Multiple Graph

Representation
    => We create adjacent list

Solving 
    => Mostly use DFS 
    => Mostly create parent to child list 

Acyclic Graph 
    => No cycles in graph 
    => No path creates a cycle 
    => No self loops 

Cyclic Graph 
    => cycles in graph 
    => path creates a cycle 
    => self loops 

Connected Graph
    => Path between every pair of vertices 

Unconnected Graph 
    => Path not their for some or all pair of vertices

Directed Graph
    => Directed path 

Undirected Graph 
    => No directed path 

Unweighted Graph

Weighted Graph 
    => Adjacency matrix
