Graph 
    => Can have any number of edges.	
    => Can form cycles; may be directed or not.
    => Root May or may not exist.	
    => Multiple paths may exist between nodes.
    => n (nodes) and m (edges) can vary freely.
    => Self loops
    => Multiple roots 
    => Multiple Graph

Representation
    => We create adjacent list
    => 

Solving 
    => Mostly use DFS 
    => Mostly create parent to child list
