Concept
Meet  
    => 2 cases 
        => fast is 1 behind => then fast = slow in next step 
        => fast is 2 behind => then fast = slow in next 2 steps
        => fast is 3 behind => the fast = slow in 3 steps 
        => fast is 4 behind => the fast = slow in 4 steps
    => so basically fast will meet slow in max k steps where k is length of cycle 

finding starting point 
m+yn+k = 2(m+xn+k);
m=(x-y)n -k;
m=pn-k
m+k = multiple of n 
n is cycle length 
m is starting point 
k is point of meet 
=> after completing p-1 cycle it comes to the same point 
=> so 
m = n-k;
m = n - k
so when we start from head and continue to slow 
head and slow will meet at m 
0=> m 
k=>n-k
