1. Conclusion from differentiation
if we break number in only two factors then n/2*n/2;
minimal difference between factors

But if we have option to break in any number of factors

When the maximum of f is larger than N, we should do the break.

(N/2)*(N/2)>=N, then N>=4

(N-1)/2 *(N+1)/2>=N, then N>=5

Factor should be 3 then 2 or 4 for maximum
